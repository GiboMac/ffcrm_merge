Fat Free CRM - Merge Contacts and Accounts
==========================================

This plugin provides functionality to merge duplicate contacts and accounts.


Usage
=====

When you hover over a contact or account, you will see a 'merge' link next to edit and delete. 
Type in a part of the name of the account or contact, and click the one that matches.
You will see a form with radio buttons, where you can choose the attributes that you want to keep or overwrite.
There is also a "Duplicate <==> Master" link in the top left corner, if you need to reverse which one is merged into the other.

A merge will move all attributes from the duplicate to the master,
including all notes/emails/opportunities/contacts/etc.
